# Product Vision: MockupGenius AI

## 🚀 The Elevator Pitch
For **App Developers and Marketers** who struggle to create high-quality promotional assets, **MockupGenius AI** is an intelligent design studio that automatically generates award-winning, photorealistic device mockups from simple screenshots. Unlike static templates (Canva, Placeit), MockupGenius uses **Generative Vision** to understand the app's context, lighting, and physics, creating unique, brand-aligned scenes instantly.

## 🌟 Core Value Proposition
1.  **Context Awareness:** It doesn't just frame the image; it understands the app. A finance app gets a corporate boardroom setting; a meditation app gets a zen garden.
2.  **Dual-Layer Fidelity:** Solves the "blurry screenshot" problem of Generative AI by separating the UI layer from the environment layer.
3.  **Marketing Ready:** We don't just give you a JPG. We give you the SEO filename, the Instagram caption, and the alt text.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- **Indie Developers:** Need Pro-level assets without a designer budget.
- **Growth Marketers:** Need to A/B test 50 different variations of an ad creative.
- **Product Managers:** Need "Hero Shots" for pitch decks and landing pages.

## 🔮 Future Direction (Roadmap)
- **Video Mockups:** Generating 5-second interaction loops on 3D devices (using Veo).
- **Brand Kits:** Upload a logo and hex code, and the AI generates the entire environment to match.
- **Figma Plugin:** Direct integration into design workflows.
